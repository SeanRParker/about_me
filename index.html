    <h1>Hi, my name Sean Parker</h1>
    <p>In my spare time I like to longboard, play video games and write music.</p>
    <p>Camping is the best stress reliever for me. I also like to go hiking.</p>
<br/>
    <p>I've lived in Indiana, California, and most recently in Virginia.</p>
<br/>
    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p>Worked at Boostability with wordpress, most recently at the State Dept. I realized I needed to know more, so I took summer off to learn here.</p>
<br />
    <p>As you can tell I love tiny houses in the middle of nowhere. I'd love to live in one someday, so long as there is wifi available, of course.</p>
